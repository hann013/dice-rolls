Dice Roll Generator
==========
This project was created to practice using Google AppEngine framework webapp2 in conjunction with Python
to create a simple web application. Moreover, this project allowed me to practice using if/else statements
and while loops to respond to user input.

The entire program is written in Python, using event handlers to trigger changes to the webpage. 

Feel free to check out the program at: http://dice-rolls.appspot.com/
